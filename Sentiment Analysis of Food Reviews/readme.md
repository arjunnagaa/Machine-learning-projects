● Implemented a machine learning model to categorize the customer reviews on various food products
into positive and negative reviews on the amazon food review dataset retrieved from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

● Data preparation: Used Word2Vec on the text data to convert it to vectors and and One-Hot encoding on categorical data in order to make my datasert fit for input in different models.


● Tried the following classification algorithms: logistic regression, KNN, random forest with hyper
parameter tuning to get the best model fit.
